My Path to Computer Science

I first got interested in computer science when I took an intro class in my junior year. Although I struggled at first with programming concepts, I found the challenge exciting and kept working at it.

What I like most about computer science is the problem-solving aspect. I enjoy figuring out how to break down big problems into smaller parts. In my senior year, I joined the programming club and worked on a project to create a simple game, which taught me a lot about teamwork and coding.

I know I have room to improve, and that's why I'm excited about the opportunity to study at your university. I'm particularly interested in software development and want to learn more about building applications that people can use.

I'm ready to work hard and make the most of the education your university offers. I believe with dedication and the right guidance, I can become a successful computer scientist.
