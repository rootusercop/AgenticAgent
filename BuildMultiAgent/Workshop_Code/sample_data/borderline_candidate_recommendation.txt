To the Admissions Committee,

I have taught Alex Rivera in Introduction to Computer Science and Data Structures over the past year and a half.

Alex is a dedicated student who demonstrates:
- Solid understanding of programming fundamentals and consistent effort in coursework
- Good work ethic and willingness to seek help when facing challenges
- Improvement over time, showing growth mindset and perseverance

While Alex may not be at the top of the class, he shows genuine interest in computer science and has made notable progress throughout his academic career. With the right support and continued dedication, I believe he has the potential to succeed in your program.

I recommend Alex for admission to your computer science program.

Sincerely,
Prof. Jennifer Martinez
