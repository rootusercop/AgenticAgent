To the Admissions Committee,

I have had the privilege of teaching Sarah Johnson for two years in Advanced Computer Science and AP Calculus.

Sarah is an exceptional student who consistently demonstrates:
- Outstanding analytical and problem-solving abilities, ranking top 1% of her class
- Natural leadership qualities - founded and successfully led our school's first AI research club with 30+ members
- Published research on neural networks in the high school science journal
- Genuine intellectual curiosity that extends well beyond curriculum requirements

In my 15 years of teaching, Sarah represents the caliber of student who not only excels academically but also inspires her peers. She has the drive, intelligence, and character to thrive in your rigorous academic environment.

I give Sarah my highest recommendation without any reservation.

Sincerely,
Dr. Michael Chen
Computer Science Department Head
Lincoln High School
