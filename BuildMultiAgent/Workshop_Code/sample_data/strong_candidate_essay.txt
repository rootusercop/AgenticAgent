My Journey into Computer Science

Ever since I built my first website at age 14, I knew I wanted to pursue computer science. What started as a simple HTML page for my school project evolved into a passion for understanding how technology shapes our world.

The ability to create solutions that impact millions of people fascinates me. During high school, I led our school's coding club and organized three successful hackathons, bringing together over 100 students. Through these experiences, I learned that computer science is not just about writing code—it's about solving real problems and building communities.

I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and its potential to solve pressing societal challenges. Last summer, I interned at a local startup where I worked on a machine learning model to predict equipment failures in hospitals, potentially saving lives and resources. Seeing my code make a tangible difference solidified my commitment to this field.

Your university's research in agentic AI and human-computer interaction aligns perfectly with my goals. I'm excited to contribute to groundbreaking research while learning from world-class faculty and collaborating with talented peers. I'm ready to take on the challenges ahead and make meaningful contributions to the field of computer science.
